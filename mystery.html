<p> Shinichi Kudo is a famous teenage detective who idolizes Sherlock Holmes and solves difficult cases with ease. One day, after a fun day at the theme park with his childhood friend Ran, Shinichi witnesses something suspicious and is knocked unconscious. What’s worse, he’s forced to take a deadly, experimental drug that shrinks his body to the age of seven. To protect himself and his loved ones from those who may want to finish the job, Shinichi dons the new name Conan Edogawa and moves in with Ran, whose father is a famous detective, in hopes of closing cases that can lead him to the men in black. But little does Shinichi know just how dangerous these men.</p>
